## Description

This project creates a multiple choice quiz question page that is timed and score is tracked. The score at the end of the quiz (time is up or all questions are answered) is saved along with your initials which you are prompted to enter into local storage. If you then open the highscores bar the information will be pulled from local storage and posted.
